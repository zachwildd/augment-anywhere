# Augment Anywhere (UMD Bitcamp 2019 Submission)
Augment Anywhere is an iOS app that allows users to create persistent voxel-based augmented reality spaces, similar to those in
games like Minecraft. In the future we plan to use this project and what we learned as a basis for creating shared augmented 
reality spaces.

# The App
These gifs demonstrate the app's two main features; adding target images & building on those target images. The first gif shows
a user adding a new target image (multiple can be added). The second shows the user building a flower in the 3D space 
associated with that target image. Users can add as many target images as possible which allows them to have seperate augmented 
reality spaces placed around the room and across campus.
